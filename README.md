# Iris Petal Length Regression

## Description

This project explores and compares the performance of two regression models—k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) and Neural Network (NN)—to predict the petal length of Iris flowers using the well-known Iris dataset. The project incorporates iterative k-value selection, a novel volume-normalization technique, and interactive 3D visualizations using Plotly.

## Introduction

The objective of this project is to predict the petal length of Iris flowers using regression models. The Iris dataset, which is widely used in machine learning, serves as the benchmark for this study.

## Data Preprocessing

- **Dataset Description:** The Iris dataset consists of 150 samples, each described by four features (sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width) and a species label.
- **Feature Selection:** We selected sepal length and sepal width as input features, and petal length as the target variable.
- **Data Splitting:** The dataset was split into 80% training and 20% testing sets.
- **Data Standardization:** Features were standardized to have a mean of zero and a standard deviation of one.

## Methodology

### k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) Regression

- Implemented an iterative k-value selection starting from k = 3 to avoid overfitting.
- Introduced a novel volume-normalization technique, calculating the area of a hyperball using the distance to the farthest k-th neighbor as the radius.

### Neural Network Regression

- Utilized a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) architecture with one hidden layer of 100 neurons.
- Trained the model with early stopping and a learning rate of 0.001.

## Experiments and Results

- **k-NN Regression:** Achieved a significant reduction in Mean Squared Error (MSE) from 9.79 to 3.86 through the iterative k-value selection and volume-normalization technique.
- **Neural Network Regression:** Demonstrated robust predictions with an MSE of 0.25.
- **Interactive 3D Visualization:** Used Plotly for interactive 3D visualizations, allowing for rotation, zooming, and panning.

## Conclusion

This project highlighted the effectiveness of iterative k-value selection and volume-normalization in improving k-NN regression performance. The neural network also provided accurate predictions, and the interactive visualizations enhanced our understanding of the model behaviors.
